# nqueens
My nqueens solution

This is a short program that solves the nqueens problem in python. It uses the random module to brute force the problem and because of this it technically could solve the problem much faster than other solutions, but it could also take an infinite amount of time to solve even the 4 queens problem. 

The program will ask you how big you want the board to be. If you input an integer it will randomly search for the first solution to the problem.
